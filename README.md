# FadeCloud Currency Converter

This is a small script I made in 1 hour to convert currencies in the FadeCloud *DUNGEONS* Server

## [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/KuryKat/FadeCloud-Currency-Converter/releases/latest)

### Usage:
Execute the .exe and type the required information, it'll output the converted value, example:

You can also add the .exe to the PATH and execute it like it is a command directly on the CMD

Command Line Usage:
```
FCCC <input_currency> <value> <output_currency>
```

### Values:

*All values are based of the clouds current pricing*

As it stands right now (06/05/2023), the conversions are the following:

* clouds = 100
    * BASE VALUE FOR OTHER CONVERSIONS
* souls = 250b 
* gems = 2.5b
* knight = 2.5m
* warrior = 1.25m
* berserker = None
    * Nobody has hit RB 50, so there's no Berserker Shards on the Market yet
* overlord   = None
    * Nobody has hit RB 75, so there's no Overlord Shards on the Market yet
