### Values:

*All values are based of the clouds current pricing*

**Last updated at Sunday, June 11, 2023**

As it stands right now, the conversions are the following:

* clouds = 100
    * BASE VALUE FOR OTHER CONVERSIONS
* souls = 250b 
* gems = 2.5b
* knight = 2.5m
* warrior = 1.25m
* berserker = None
    * Nobody has hit RB 50, so there's no Berserker Shards on the Market yet
* overlord   = None
    * Nobody has hit RB 75, so there's no Overlord Shards on the Market yet
